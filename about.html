        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm <strong>Jill Daniel</strong>, a proud student who has successfully completed <strong>Form 4</strong> with a passion not just for code — but for solving meaningful real-world problems using technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently preparing to join university, where I aim to study <strong>Data Science</strong>. My dream is to transform raw data into insights that empower communities, businesses, and the future of Africa.
